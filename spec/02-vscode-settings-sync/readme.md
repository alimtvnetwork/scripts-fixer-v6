# Spec: VS Code Profile Importer

## Overview

A PowerShell utility that imports a full VS Code profile — **settings.json**,
**keybindings.json**, and **extensions** — for both **Stable** and **Insiders** editions.

---

## Problem

Setting up VS Code on a new machine or after a reinstall requires:

1. Manually copying `settings.json` and `keybindings.json`
2. Individually installing each extension
3. Exporting/importing profiles through VS Code's UI

This is tedious and error-prone, especially when maintaining the same config
across multiple machines.

## Solution

A structured PowerShell script that:

- Accepts a `.code-profile` export file **or** individual JSON files
- Parses the profile to extract settings, keybindings, and extension list
- Backs up existing files before overwriting
- Copies `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` into the correct VS Code user settings path
- Installs all enabled extensions via CLI (`code --install-extension`)
- Supports both **VS Code Stable** and **VS Code Insiders**
- Provides colorful, structured terminal output with status badges

## Input Priority

The script uses this priority for source data:

1. **`.code-profile` file** — If present in the script folder, the profile is
   parsed automatically to extract settings, keybindings, and extensions.
2. **Individual JSON files** — Falls back to `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`,
   and `extensions.json` if no profile file is found (or parsing fails).

## config.json Schema

| Key                                  | Type     | Description                                         |
|--------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `editions.stable.settingsPath`       | string   | Path to Stable VS Code user settings dir            |
| `editions.stable.cliCommand`         | string   | CLI command for Stable (`code`)                     |
| `editions.insiders.settingsPath`     | string   | Path to Insiders VS Code user settings dir          |
| `editions.insiders.cliCommand`       | string   | CLI command for Insiders (`code-insiders`)          |
| `enabledEditions`                    | string[] | Which editions to target (`["stable","insiders"]`)  |
| `backupSuffix`                       | string   | Suffix for backup files (e.g. `.backup`)            |

## extensions.json Schema

```json
{
  "extensions": ["id1", "id2"],
  "disabled": ["id3", "id4"]
}
```

Only `extensions` (enabled) are installed. The `disabled` list is kept for reference.

## Execution Flow

1. Load `log-messages.json` → display banner
2. Load `config.json` → determine enabled editions
3. Check for `.code-profile` → parse settings, keybindings, extensions if found
4. Fall back to individual JSON files for any missing data
5. For each enabled edition:
   a. Check if the CLI command is available (`code` / `code-insiders`)
   b. Backup existing `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` (timestamp + suffix)
   c. Copy settings and keybindings to the edition's settings path
   d. Install each enabled extension via CLI
6. Display summary footer

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11**
- **PowerShell 5.1+**
- **VS Code installed** (Stable and/or Insiders)
- **VS Code CLI (`code` / `code-insiders`) in PATH**

## How to Run

```powershell
# From the project root:
.\run.ps1 -I 2
```

## Design Decisions

| Decision                    | Rationale                                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Profile-first parsing       | Users can drop a .code-profile export and it just works      |
| Fallback to individual JSON | Flexibility — users can also curate files manually           |
| Keybindings support         | Profiles include keybindings; a complete import requires them |
| Separate extensions.json    | Easy to maintain extension list without editing script logic |
| Timestamp backup            | Never lose existing settings, multiple backups coexist       |
| Edition loop                | Single script handles both Stable and Insiders               |
| CLI-based extension install | Official supported method, no registry hacking needed        |
| No admin required           | Settings and extensions are per-user, no elevation needed    |
